		<h1>Step 4</h1>
		<h2>Made a searching and fearless inventory of ourselves</h2>
		<p>This is where the work begins.You will work on your fears, your resentments, your life history<br>
	       All to give it your higher power to handle. This process is challenging because you may remember<br>
	       the big things, such as abusive relationship, but won't remember dropping a battery on your foot<br>
	       just yesterday. You will be adding to the list as time goes on and that's ok. You will remember things<br>
	       things that you locked away deep in your psyche, but you will have support through the group,<br>
	       members and whatever sponsor you take up. The big question here is "why do it at all"? Why bring<br>
	       up all this baggage? Well, all this baggage has been haunting us for years if not longer. Pulling<br>
	       our strings from the sidelines. I can only speak for myself here, but I can tell you this, when I hear<br>
	       others speak about their experiences, I'm like, damn man, I went through that as well and i'm <br>
	       currently going through that. For example: My dad left at 12 when he found out that I was<br>
		   mentally challenged (bipolar). Later that would give me abandonment issues that would make <br>
	       me very dependent on my mother and later females for my emotional and physical support.<br>
	       I would not feel comfortable in my body and would pickup and continue a porn habit along<br>
	       with objectification of women and getting sex workers. See how one little event can manipulate<br> 
	       your whole life in a horrible direction? See how the baggage is with you if you don't course correct?</p>
