			<h1>Sponsorship</h1>
			<p>I'm going to be honest with you, this program isn't easy. It takes willpower AND faith. You can't
have one without the other, believe me, I've tried.<br>This is where a sponsor comes in, or a
person that can walk you through the process so you can get out the other end.<br>
The best way I can describe this is by example.</p>
			<h2>Sponsor 1</h2>
			<p>My first sponsor didn't really follow protocol. He was a social worker and did his part to keep
me grounded.<br>During our meetings he helped me discover myself through psychology and social work,
I learned alot,<br> but I was still acting out on my bottomlines (watching porn and seeing hookers).<br>
The problem was I didn't accept my higher power, I didn't accept that their were things outside
of my control.<br> I continued to get emotional and catastrophize everything. Sure I found myself
but I never really worked on the root causes of why I acted out,<br> giving in to the inevitable
and accepting it for what it is.</p>
			<h2>Sponsor 2</h2>
			<p>My current sponsor was different all together. He brought the social work aspect to the field
as well as the Steps.<br> He was the best of both worlds. I thought of him as my best friend simply
because we started working together,<br>he had my back and has been a great role model.
Behavior wise, we have worked on the steps and are on step 4.<br> He has supported me through it
because he believes I can conquer the pain and suffering that is my past and <br>present and come
out the other end. In all honesty here, I wish my father was like this, but we can't win every
battle right? </p>
			<p>The take away here is that we as sponsors play multiple roles because we believe in the program
and you. So in order to do that we must be a<br>pseudo-therapist at times, best friend at others,
program director, and even worst enemy. </p>
