			<h1>What is a Support</h1>
			<p>Going into this I didn't know what a support actually was.<br>
I thought a support was someone who would take care of me.<br>
Would watch over me, would provide for me, give me exactly what I wanted<br>
When I Wanted it.</p>
			<p>Don't get me wrong, this program isn't about telling you how to feel, but for me and many others,<br>
this is what we experienced. You have to find your own way through the mud that is acting out.<br>
I can't carry you, but I can support you.<br>
Now what exactly is a support, a healthy support?</p>
			<p>For me it's having an ear and advice, someone to help take my mind off of the suffering that i'm feeling.<br>
Sure I have to do this myself and i'm learning to do so, but for right now, it's better than watching porn<br>
or WORSE</p>
			<p>This support would remind the other participant that there is light at the end of the tunnel.<br>
That life doesn't end when they relapse. That life is filled with more splendor than the addiction<br>
could ever offer. I will go over some of these things in my Lines section in more detail.<br>
They would also remind them that the 12 steps of recovery are a great resource,<br>
one of the primary resources to a successful recovery.</p>
