		<h1>Step 1</h1>
		<h2>We Admited we were powerless over our addiction, that our lives had become unmanageable</h2>
		<p>This took me quite a while to work through. I didn't want to admit that I had a problem<br>
hell, everyone else was the problem. Well, that was the problem... If I can give anyone some<br>
advice on this to help them through this step I would say be honest with yourself.<br>
Can you look in the mirror and honestly say your safe? That your health isn't at risk?<br>
That your relationships aren't at risk? That your FUTURE isn't at risk?<br>
Honesty is the core of this program, with yourself, with others and with your higher power.</p>
