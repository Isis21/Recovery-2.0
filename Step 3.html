		<h1>Step 3</h1>
		<h2>Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood him</h2>
		<p>This is your action step. If you chose the traditional route, you would follow traditional doctrine,<br>
	       whichever you choose. This will solidify your path towards the arms of your God. If you have any<br>
	       questions in this area, I am not the person to ask lol. I haven't read the whole bible or Quran.<br>
	       If you choose Option 2, you can communicate with your higher self through meditation,<br> 
		   Yoga or any activity that brings you closer to that future self that you hope to aspire to. Another <br> 
	       little cavate, is to Treat yourself with respect and love, like you would another person, but also <br>
	       be realistic,honest and accountable. To do this by saying postive affirmations to myself such I <br>
	       "I am Loveable",by dressing nicely and maintaing good hygiene, taking care of my responsibilities, <br>
	       and maintaining a clean environment. Option 3 is using the group. You can communicate with other  <br>
	       members and the group meetings as a way to connect with those "ah ha" moments and   <br>
	       communicate with your higher power. The group is a great resource no matter what path you choose.</p>
