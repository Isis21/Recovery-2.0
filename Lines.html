			<p>What is a Top Line and what is their purpose? What is some examples of Top lines?<br> What
is a Bottom line and a Middle Circle (Slippery Slope)? I will discuss these next.</p>
			<h2>Bottom-Line</h2>
			<p>Bottom Line behaviors are the behaviors that you A: don't want to do, B: others don't want you to do and/or<br>
C:Will get/ is hurt you or kill you. These behaviors can range from pornography, prostitutes, drinking,<br>
eating excessivly, gambling, recreational drugs, prescription drugs, etc. The list can go on really<br>
Hell, you can be addicted to work. Think of it like this, if it harms you and your life is unmanageable,<br>
your an addict. It just depends if you can accept it yet (Step 1).</p>
			<h2>Middle Circle</h2>
			<p>Middle Circle behaviors are the behaviors that can get you into trouble or lead to trouble.<br> These vary
from person to person in the rooms. In SA, some can masturbate while staying sober, others can't.<br> In
AA, some can go near a bar or beer distributer and be ok, others will go in and get some booze.<br>
These middle circle behaviors are like I put it, a slippery slope. Instead of pushing your limits<br>
on your bottom lines; why not push the limits on your top lines?</p>
			<h2>Top-Line</h2>
			<p>Top Line behaviors are the behaviors that keep you sober and healthy. These not just keep you closer<br>
to your higher power, but keep you closer to yourself. You can discover so much about yourself if<br>
just give in and let life be life, accept you don't have any control over certain things, like death<br>
Paying rent, losing a significant other, paying taxes and accept the control you do have. Use the<br>
descretion your higher power gave you to make a sound decision and CHOOSE to be happy.</p>
