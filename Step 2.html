		<h1>Step 2</h1>
		<h2>Came to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.</h2>
		<p>Before you run for the hills there is many ways of looking at this higher power thing.<br>
	       For starters a simple definition is something larger than yourself that can sustain you<br>
	       in your recovery. This thing has to be healthy and constantly keep you moving forward.<br>
	       At the very least it has to keep you maintaining healthy habits if not progressing towards<br>
	       something. This larger thing can be traditional God, Allah, etc, etc. I'm not a huge fan<br>
	       but, I will admit that believing in a traditional God works in this program if you can wrap<br>
	       your head around the concepts and give yourself fully. Option 2 is the option I took.<br>
	       It requires you to believe in one thing, that a greater sense of yourself exist and is attainable.<br>
	       Option 3 is the group.You can look at the meetings as maintaining your honesty <br> 
		   and accountability towards your recovery.</p>
